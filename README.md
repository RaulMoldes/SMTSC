# Sentiment classification from scratch.

In this project I aim to build a sentiment classification system, using a transformer encoder built from scratch.
To accomplish this, I will implement the transformer architecture, which has proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks. The transformer encoder will be trained on a large dataset of labeled sentiment analysis examples.

The steps involved in building the sentiment classification system are as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing: I will preprocess the text data by tokenizing it, removing stop words, and performing any necessary text cleaning.

2. Model Architecture: I will implement the transformer encoder from scratch, including the self-attention mechanism and feed-forward neural network layers.

3. Training: I will train the sentiment classification model using a suitable optimization algorithm, such as Adam, and monitor its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

4. Evaluation: I will evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

5. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, I will deploy it as a sentiment classification service, allowing users to input text and receive sentiment predictions.

By building this sentiment classification system from scratch, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the transformer architecture and its application in natural language processing tasks.
